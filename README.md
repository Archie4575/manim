diceroll/ - Visualising the results of rolling a dice n times
complex/ - Visualising the complex roots of a quadratic. The graph is shown in the xy plane before the imaginary plane coming out of the screen. The vertical axis now represents only the real component of the result of the quadratic when given a complex input. This forms a surface made that first touches the horizontal plane at the complex roots.
